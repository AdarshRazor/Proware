# Proware
Proware is program which gives you full freedom to visit any website, hides your identity, secure your files, defend from RANSOMEWARE, check the links as well. This will be possible with one click !!

[Works in python 2.x and 3.x, refer to specific .py files for each python version and for **windows only** as of now] 

Using "https://www.virustotal.com/" API's this code lets you pick one file to check for virus that   
runs the file through almost 50 plus online anti-virus engines.   
Using this code you don't have to go to the website manually and do the extra steps.   
Just run the code and select the file or url (weblink) and wait for the final .txt document to see the condition of your   
selected file.  
If there are no viruses found then no .txt file will be generated and a pop-up saying the same will be shown.  

P . S : If the code doesn't work, then do let me know.
